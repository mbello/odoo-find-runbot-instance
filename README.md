This package can be used by Odoo devs looking to test their integration/RPC code against a safe/sandbox live Odoo instance.

The runbot servers offer many such instances, which this module can access to find and return url, database and user credentials
of some of these live instances.

Try to be light with your teste, do not abuse Odoo's runbot servers.
